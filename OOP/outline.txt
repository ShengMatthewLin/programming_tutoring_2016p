1. A quick example: option pricing with procedural oriented code
2. Issues with the procedural oriented code
3. What is object oriented programming?
    a. bond pricing
4. Features:
    a. abstraction
    b. encapsulation
    c. polymorphism
    d. inheritance
5. Alternative OOP implementation
6. Further improvements
    a. new security types
    b. duplicated codes for the solver
    c. classes with too many parameters for the constructor
    d. global configuration and logger
7. Design patterns
    a. singleton
    b. builder
    c. factory
8. Extend this example to a more complicated system
    a. handle different types of securities (inheritance)
    b. compute nav, risks and other analytics on the portfolio level (polymorphism)
    c. loader and feeder for market and economy data (abstraction and encapsulation)
    d. math utility functions: solver, optimizer, integrator (reusability)
